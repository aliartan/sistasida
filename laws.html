In order to process personal data, you must comply with the Data Protection Regulation; you may only collect personal data for specific, explicitly stated, and legitimate purposes; you may not process more personal data than is necessary for the purposes; you must ensure that personal data is accurate; you must delete personal data when it is no longer needed; and you must protect personal data, for example, by encrypting it.</p><h2> COPYRIGHT</h2><p> If they are sufficiently creative, music, visuals, paintings, pictures, writings, computer games, and sculptures can all be protected by copyright. When a work is made, the creator becomes the author, and the right to create arises naturally. It makes no difference whether the work is judged good or awful; what matters is the originality. One advantage is that people have the flexibility to utilize other people's photos as long as they add their own creative touch to them. On the other hand, the work that has been put into things by the creators may be weakened because the person who put a creative spin on it can call it theirs, and sometimes only a small amount of creativity is required to call something yours, which will negatively influence the creator.</p><h2> LEK</h2><p> The law covers the notion of electronic communication across all sorts of electronic communication networks, including telephony, the Internet, and cable television. The law established an unified and technology-neutral regulatory framework for all electronic communications in response to the reality that products and services in the field are becoming increasingly platform-agnostic.</p></div><div><img src="images/imagegallery2.jpg" alt="Yone"></div></div></body></html>
